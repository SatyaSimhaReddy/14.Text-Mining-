0,  The product just overheating.. it is unbelievable from such great company production devices.  Here the cost does not matter but product quality is matters.1. builtin Alex is not working2. Average camera3. Overheating.I have been one plus 6t device since 2.5 so far single problem face.. I just upgraded to one plus 9 but it seems to be the worst decision. I did it as I am feeling now.
1,"  Just got d phone today... frm day 1 too much overheating issue... Not possible to use...Also battery issue, 20% battery drained out in 15 minutes..."
2,  One day delivery. Very fast. Kuddos on that.The phone is amazing. No complains so far. 3 days of heavy usage to check battery camera music everything.Would definitely say one of the best cameras. Sound could have been louder but not at all bad. Battery is excellent. Interface touch smoothness WOW.Didn't give 5 stars as always scope of improvement. But overall go for it. Remain a one plus fan
3,"  Dear Buyers,I bought this phone for my younger brother as his birthday gift. I was outside the city when I got this delivered to him. He was facing issues with this phone from the first day, but he didn't inform me since I gave him a gift and didn't feel like complaining about a gift. It's only after I met him I came to know that :1. This phone has serious heating issues. Gets so much hot while charging that a human hand can't hold it.2. Battery Draining issue. The battery doesn't last more than 5 hours after 100% charge with normal to low usage. If you keep the phone and stare at the battery percentage, you can actually see it going down in front of your eyes.3. Overrated camera. The amount paid for this phone doesn't justify the quality of the cameras, and the entire thing is overrated.4. I would clearly recommend buying an iPhone 11 instead. Way better battery life, camera, durability and software experience.I tried returning the phone immediately, but amazon did not accept the return and asked us to run some tests. On running the test they advised that the phone is perfect and we might be not using it right. Beautiful isn't it? And now we are stuck with this worthless heating brick."
